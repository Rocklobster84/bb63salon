      <h1>About</h1>
      <div class="block"></div>
      <p>
        Established in 2010, we have been a staple salon in Fort Worth Texas for many years. Originally we opened a
        location on Bluebonnet Circle near TCU, then added another near the historic Fort Worth Stockyards. After
        taking a bit of time away to focus on family, we are pleased to announce that in October 2022 we reopened one
        single location in the historic Ridglea Theater strip, at 3309 Winthrop Ave., Suite 67, Fort Worth, TX 76116.
        We are located on the historic Camp Bowie Boulevard right next to the Ridglea Room. As lovers of local talent
        and all things music, we have always supported the Fort Worth Rock Assembly, and now we are happy to say that
        we share a building with three incredible music venues. Because of that however, we do have limited openings
        in the evenings. Although we love the sound of a great live concert, we still want to provide our clients
        with the best atmosphere possible for a relaxing service. At BB 63 Salon, you will find some of the best
        hairstylists and the most amazing estheticians in town. Each member of our salon aims to please and takes
        great pride in satisfying each and every guest. Please review all of our services and let us help you to feel
        beautiful inside and out. Consider scheduling an aesthetic service, either before or after your hair service,
        and we will do our best to accommodate! We look forward to hearing from you soon!

          Hi, my name is Leah and I have been in this industry for 20 years. Due to the  Covid-19 pandemic, I took
          some time off, but quickly realized just how much I missed my clients! Because of this, I knew I had to
          come back to the hair industry. I have missed it tremendously, and I’m so glad to be back at BB 63 Salon. I
          love making long-lasting relationships with my guests and making people feel both confident and beautiful.
          Currently, I’m available on Mondays, from 10am to 6pm, and on Fridays, from 10am to 4pm. Occasionally, I
          will have overflow on other days, so if you don’t find a time that works for you, please text me and I will
          see what I can do to accommodate. Thank you so much for viewing my profile! Hope to book something with you soon!

            Hi! I’m so glad you’re here and even happier you’re trusting me with your skin. I have been through my own battles with acne and struggled with severe cystic acne in my early 20s. I started working with an esthetician and trusted the process and got my skin completely cleared! After going through that I knew I wanted to be able to help others. I love being able to provide clients an answer to what is causing their acne instead of just selling them a product.
          </p>
          <p>
            After working at a facial spa for 2 years I decided I wanted more! So March 2021 I opened Skin By Salena. It was the best decision I ever made! Facials and skincare are my life! When I’m not in my suite you’ll find me at Target or a local Fort Worth bar sipping on an espresso martini! I’m a Fort Worth native and live in a cozy house with my husband and our 2 dogs Hazel & Elbe.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Skin By Salena I am all about providing you with results, education, and a game plan! I’m here to cheer you on as we work together to achieve your skincare goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Voted best facial in Fort Worth and DFW in 2023!!<br />
            Come get a facial with me where you’ll get the glowy skin, results, and a forever esty bestie!
