      <h1>About</h1>
      <div class="block"></div>
      <p>
        Established in 2010, we have been a staple salon in Fort Worth Texas for many years. Originally we opened a
        location on Bluebonnet Circle near TCU, then added another near the historic Fort Worth Stockyards. After
        taking a bit of time away to focus on family, we are pleased to announce that in October 2022 we reopened one
        single location in the historic Ridglea Theater strip, at 3309 Winthrop Ave., Suite 67, Fort Worth, TX 76116.
        We are located on the historic Camp Bowie Boulevard right next to the Ridglea Room. As lovers of local talent
        and all things music, we have always supported the Fort Worth Rock Assembly, and now we are happy to say that
        we share a building with three incredible music venues. Because of that however, we do have limited openings
        in the evenings. Although we love the sound of a great live concert, we still want to provide our clients
        with the best atmosphere possible for a relaxing service. At BB 63 Salon, you will find some of the best
        hairstylists and the most amazing estheticians in town. Each member of our salon aims to please and takes
        great pride in satisfying each and every guest. Please review all of our services and let us help you to feel
        beautiful inside and out. Consider scheduling an aesthetic service, either before or after your hair service,
        and we will do our best to accommodate! We look forward to hearing from you soon!

          I’m Cozzette, the owner of BB 63 Salon. I have been in this industry for 16 years, and I just recently
          opened another salon here in Funky Town. I told myself after my kids started school I would revisit owning
          a salon again, so that’s exactly what I did. I love working with the public and being such a huge presence
          in the service industry. I strive to use eco and animal friendly products. I do my absolute best to
          recycle, and try to limit the amount of unnecessary waste. I am proud to offer gender-neutral pricing,
          meaning all prices are based on the time it takes to perform a service, not gender identity. At BB 63
          Salon, all are welcome and will always be treated equally. “Come as you are, we’ll fix you up!” I typically
          work Tuesday through Thursday, most Sundays and every other Saturday. I offer many services including
          perms, however, certain services may require a consultation or may need to be performed on a weekday. Due
          to my current workload, I rarely have openings in the evenings or on weekends. If you would like an evening
          appointment, and you don’t see an availability with me, please consider scheduling  something with Leah. I
          look forward to seeing you soon, and thank you so much for viewing my profile!

          Hi, my name is Leah and I have been in this industry for 20 years. Due to the  Covid-19 pandemic, I took
          some time off, but quickly realized just how much I missed my clients! Because of this, I knew I had to
          come back to the hair industry. I have missed it tremendously, and I’m so glad to be back at BB 63 Salon. I
          love making long-lasting relationships with my guests and making people feel both confident and beautiful.
          Currently, I’m available on Mondays, from 10am to 6pm, and on Fridays, from 10am to 4pm. Occasionally, I
          will have overflow on other days, so if you don’t find a time that works for you, please text me and I will
          see what I can do to accommodate. Thank you so much for viewing my profile! Hope to book something with you soon!
